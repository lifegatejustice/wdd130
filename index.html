        <p>Hello! My name is Lifegate Justice and I am from Abia State, Nigeria. I enjoy exploring all kinds of technologies, I love Football, Coding and Video games. I also love troubleshooting computer and mobile phone problems. My journey in graphics design began on march 9 2023 when my Bishop reffred me to a non-governmental organization Connak Foundtion, where I discovered the power of visual storytelling and honed my skills in creating captivating designs that leave a lasting impact.

            In the world of web development, I found my calling by also stating PathwayConnect, fueled by a desire to bring innovative ideas to life through clean and efficient code, I perserved the uncomfortabilities I faced during my journey. I curently study Software Development at BYU Idaho. Whether it's crafting visually appealing designs or developing seamless and user-friendly websites, I am dedicated to delivering solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover the intersection of creativity and technology. If you have any inquiries or if you'd like to collaborate, I'd love to hear from you! </p>
