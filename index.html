        <p>Hello! My name is Lifegate Justice and I am from Abia State, Nigeria. I enjoy exploring all kinds of technologies, I love Football, Coding and Video games. I also love troubleshooting computer and mobile phone problems. My journey in graphics design began on march 9 2023 when my Bishop reffred me to a non-governmental organization Connak Foundtion, where I discovered the power of visual storytelling and honed my skills in creating captivating designs that leave a lasting impact.

            In the world of web development, I found my calling by also attending Connak Foundation, fueled by a desire to bring innovative ideas to life through clean and efficient code, I was taught by the mastermind "Bight Onyekachi"
            
            Whether it's crafting visually appealing designs or developing seamless and user-friendly websites, I am dedicated to delivering solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.
            
            Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover the intersection of creativity and technology. If you have any inquiries or if you'd like to collaborate, I'd love to hear from you! </p>

        <p>Nigeria is a country in Africa.Nigeria is often called the <b>"Giant of Africa."</b> This name comes from the vastness of its land, the diversity of its peoples and languages, its huge population (the largest in Africa), and its oil and other natural resources. It is bordered by Chad and Cameroon to the east, Niger to the north and Republic of Benin in the west.
